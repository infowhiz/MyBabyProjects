                <h2>About Mom</h2>
                <p>My mom was a highly versatile person. You would love her. She was an awesome mom, an extraordinary cook,
                    a master gardener. And you know what? Being a family person didn't keep her having a successful career.
                    She was holding a masters in social anthropology. She had been started her career as an economic development
                    planning specialist for government. Once she had been head of the office of arts & culture of a
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalopolis">megalopolis</a>. She also had served as general
                    secretary of multiple highly esteemed associations. These are only some of her great qualities that come
                    to my mind at a glance. But other than that, you could talk with her about almost anything. She was an
                    intellectual, smart, nice and fun person to be around. Hard to believe right? I miss her.. Can you tell?</p>
